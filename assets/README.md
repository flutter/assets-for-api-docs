## Assets Directory

This directory is where served diagram assets go. Assets are placed in
subdirectories which describe the category that they belong to in the API. Do
not place files directly in this directory.

The automated generation script in `../diagrams/generate.dart` will place the its final output
here.

Static assets which are not generated may also be placed here.

Be sure that all assets placed here are unencumbered by licenses and have permissive copyrights.
