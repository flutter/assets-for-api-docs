# Image Capture

A package for capturing images of diagrams with Flutter.

This package helps in creating diagrams for Flutter documentation. The intention
is that any diagrams we produce are created using Flutter so that if widgets or
behavior change, we can easily keep our API documentation up-to-date.

This package makes it easy to create diagram images from a widget hierarchy. See
the example in the "example" directory, or any of the production diagrams for
examples of use.
